# Application-of-Central-Limit-Theorem

This Project is divided into two parts. The first one uses flight-delay dataset and the task is to choose an airline which is most likely to get on or before time
<br>
The second Part is a demonstration of Central Limit Theorem and its four aspects.
<br>
## Four Aspects of Central Limit Theorem:<br>
1) Sampling Distribution of the mean will be less spread than the values in population from which the sample is drawn.<br>
2) Sampling distribution will be well-modeled by a normal distribution (and will get closer with increasing sample size)<br>
3) Spread of the sampling distribution is related to the spread of population values as mean(population)=mean(sampling distribution)
and standard_deviation(population)= standard_deviation(sampling distribution)* sqrt(n) where n is the sample size.<br>
4) Bigger samples lead to a smaller spread in the sampling distribution.<br><br>
